This program gives the user simple commands to generate the cohomology
of the Steenrod algebra at odd primes using the cobar complex.

In the file test.py, there are numerous tests to demonstrate the
functionality of the program. Of greatest importance is the command
cohom_test(f). This command will give a printout of the cohomology of the
Steenrod algebra at an odd prime.

To simplify the code, global variables are used with the help of the
options class, and specifically, the Options object opts. To change
the prime, set opts.prime = p to the prime p you desire before running
any commands. To change the largest degree to be considered in the
program, change opts.bounds = b as you desire.

This program is in its early stages, but is functional.
TODO:
1) Product structure

2) Massey products

3) Extend existing saved cobar complex to meet the desired bounds and
filtration length

4) Implement a Monomial object which allows for exponent notation

5) Use multiprocessing when making the maps, complex, and calculating
cohomology

6) Ensure functionality at the prime 2 as well. It will be slow, but
it will allow Massey product calculations
